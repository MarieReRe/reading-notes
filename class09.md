### Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
#### How Forms Work: 
        1. A user fills in information in a form then presses a button to submit the form. This then goes to a server. 
        2. The name of each form control is sent to the server. The value the user enters or selects is also sent. 
        3. The server processes the information using a programming language. This information may or may not be stored in a database.
        4. The server creates a new page to send back based on information recieved.
