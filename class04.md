#HTML & CSS
## Ch. 4 Links

- Links are used with the anchor element  <a>  and specify the target directry href attribute
- To link to another site you need the full address known as the absolute URL.
- To link to another page you can use what is called the Relative URL
- You can add Email links by using < a > element then attribute href="mailto:email@adress.com"
- You can open a new window when you click a link by adding the attribute **target="_blank"**
- You can link to a specific part of a page by utilizing id on that part of the site, and then linking it with < a > href="#theID"

## Ch.15 Layout

-  CSS treats each HTML element as if it's in it's own box, either an inline or a block level box
- If a block element is nested inside another block element, then the outer box is the containing or the parent element
- You can change the layout of the page using the position property in CSS; ex: normal flow, relative positioning and 
  absolute positioning, also to indicate where the box should be positioned we can use box offset properties.



# JavaScript & JQuery
## Ch. 3 Functions, Methods, and Objects

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
- A function will not run until it is called
      - An example of calling a function is: **functionName();
- Before you can call a function, you need to declare it by using the function keyword, 
  then the function name and the code block in curly brackets, the value inside the parameters are called **arguments**
- If a function is saved into a variable, it's called function expression, ex: area = function(x,y) etc, 
  if its not saved into a variable it's called anonymous function.
- If you declare a variable within a function, it will be useable only inside that function, this is known 
  as **variables scope**, it's called local variable.
- Variables reference a value that is stored, the same value can be used with more than one variable.


## Paired Programming

- Pair programming has two main roles, the driver and the navigator, the driver is the programmer who types, while the
  navigator guides the driver and thinks about the big picture.
- Pair programming help you with efficiency, as two people working on the same problem can come with solutions
  faster than one person.
- It also helps with focusing, when two programmers work together they focus better.
- Learn from fellow students and colleagues, as you can see new problem solving methods and add them to your own.
- It can improve your social skills since you work with another person who might have a different coding style.
- Job, interview, and work environment readiness.
