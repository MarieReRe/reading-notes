# HTML & CSS

###### Introduction p.2-11
A brief intro into how the web works and how it handles HTML and CSS. 

###### Structure p. 12-39
- How webpages are structured 
- HTML uses tags

HTML code to provide effects:
- Elements 
  - characters that live inside angled brackets
            - Usually made up of two tags; an opening tag and a closing tag
                - Opening tag example (<p></p>)
     - Tags act like containers to tell you something about the information 
            that lies between their opening and closing tags
        - Attributes 
          - provide additional information about the contents of an element
            - Appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts;
            a name and a value separated by an equals sign
                - Name and value example - lang="en-us"
        - Body
          - Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window
        - Head 
          - You may see this and it will be before body.  This contains information 
        about the page vs shown on the page.  Often has title inside the head element.
        - Title 
          - The contents are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you
        usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page if your browser uses tabs

- ### What are Site Maps
Site maps are diagrams that layout key elements and pages to structure your website.
There is a technique called **card sorting** that involves placing each piece of information 
a visitor might need to know on a seperate piece of paper anf then organizing that paper into groups. 
These papers are then turned into a diagram.

- ### WireFrames
A simple sketch of key information that will go on each page of a site you are building and how much
space elements need. This does not include color schemes, font choices bacgrounds or images.

- ### Design 
   1. Getting your message across
          - Content of page
          - Prioritizing what design elements to emphasize key info
          - Organizing through grouping in blocks or chunks, like items
          - Visual hierarchy draws the eye to a key aspect
              - Size - headings and key points relatively large
              - Color - foreground and background color to draw attention to key messages
              - Style - to make elements stand out
              - Images - create high visual contract
              
    2.  Grouping: Group similar items together, use consistency.
         - Proximity grouping
         - Closure grouping
         - Continuance grouping
         - White space promoting
         - Color - background
         - Borders - around whole element
          
    3. Navigation
