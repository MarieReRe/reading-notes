## JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
###### So far we already use a debugging method everyday in class: the console.log() method!  

Why: We debug because our programming code might contain syntax errors or logical errors. 
Sometimes these errors can be hard to find and diagnose. It can be as simple as forgetting 
a comma, adding one too many commas, or spelling a variable name wrong. 


What: A bug is an error or flaw within our program. These bugs can make our program not run,
trigger errors, and many other unexpected outcomes like freezing your computer. Debugging is the process of finding errors. 

How: There are a few ways you can debug. You can use the console.log() method throughout your
code, you can set breakpoints, use a debugger keyword, or a debugging program. (Visual Studio Code has one built in)
