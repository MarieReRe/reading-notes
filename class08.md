# HTML & CSS 

### HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

1. t/f : CSS treats each HTML element as if it's in it's own circle, either an inline or a block level circle.
2. t/f : If a block element is nested inside another block element, then the outer box is the containing or the parent element.
3. t/f : You can change the layout of the page using the position property in CSS; ex: normal flow, relative positioning and absolute positioning, also to indicate where the box should be positioned we can use box offset properties.
4. t/f : You can't include multiple CSS in one page.
5. t/f : Designers try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.
